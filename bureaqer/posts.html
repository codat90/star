            On 11th of February, SASD's second annual ceremony was held at Dillimore. A large number of civilians and Law Enforcement personnel came to witness. Some top guns including SAPD's Lieutenant Shaquana Howard and FBI's Director Matthew Reiner were also seen enjoying the event. The primary aim of the ceremony was to recognize the efforts of Deputies and appreciate their tasks. Undersherrif Aberama, being the host, said that these people work day and night tirelessly just to maintain law and order. He further thanked them for the dedication they have towards the Department. In the ceremony, many Sherrifs including Tyler Arkwood and Eric Salleri recieved new ranks. An award-giving session was also conducted thereafter where Deputies who did something out-of-the-box were blessed with awards. At the end, Aberama once again applauded the Deputies by calling them a "backbone" of the Sherrif Department.
