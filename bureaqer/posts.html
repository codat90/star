            San Andreas's once bountiful mines are starting to run dry, causing major concern for miners and the local economy. According to recent reports, the amount of ores extracted from the mines has decreased significantly in recent months, leading to a decline in production levels and profits.

            This trend has left many miners struggling to make ends meet, with some even abandoning their mines in search of better opportunities. Some have been forced to lay off workers, further exacerbating the economic impact of the mines' decline.

            There are many factors for the decrease in ores, including over-mining, lack of investment, and changes in the market demand for certain types of minerals.

            This news was made upon the opinion and request of the miners who did not want to reveal their identity. The accuracy of the information is not certain and an explanation is expected from the government.
