            On every day of the year, a new incident happens at Idlewood, specifically at the GS9. More often than not, these end up with tragedies; mass shootings, injured and deceased bystanders, peace officers, gang members, and pretty much anyone that happens to be present during the altercations. But who is to blame for all of these?
