            Around 19CET, an unidentified flying object were spotted above the airspace of GS9.
Many civilians saw the UFO, oval form with a red light coming from his bottom, it is believed the so called "Aliens" were more likely scouting the area and his surroundings quarters as well his inabitants for unknown reasons.
The UFO is tested by firearms and consequently stated "indestructible", even with San andreas heaviest weapons; Also like things were'nt enough weird and strange, the UFO for a short time, flying under 10 meters from the ground, which is strictly forbidden by flying protocols, therefore, openly defying the ATC authorities, which gave no sign of response.
Apparently, the government didn't even stand a feet or a single defensive or offensive precautive, creating by the mean, a feeling of unsafety and fear within San Andreas inhabitant's heart.
What will outcome of this weird event? Are aliens our friends or foes? What do they want from human being?
