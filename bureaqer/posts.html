    <h2>United States of America v. Layla White</h2>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>
            On the 3rd of September, 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation acted on a suspicious public advertisement made by Layla White, through which she was trying to sell "toy cases". A federal agent set up a deal with the suspect and purchased two cases of M4 assault rifles along with 2 cases of sniper rifles. Two days later, Layla White's properties were raided by the F.B.I., in which they found 1518 grams of cannabis sativa, multiple pots for growing the cannabis, 6 C4 explosive devices, and 15,225 marked dollars.
