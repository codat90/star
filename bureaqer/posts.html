            Four individuals were being chased by the law enforcement in a high speed vehicle pursuit throughout East Los Santos. Evading in a green Premier, the suspects flipped their car at Las Colinas after a SAPD Volunteer performed a pursuit intervention technique; the vehicle caught flames while the malefactors got out and took distance. The whole situation evolved into a foot chase and respectively a shootout, in which, the peace officers came out victorious.
