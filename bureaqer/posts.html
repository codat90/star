            Earlier today two women got assaulted by an individualÂ right in front of the S.W.A.T. Headquarters; a mother, Sophia Williams, along with her daughter Jessica Cortez. In shock and tears, they spoke with the police force and provided a detailed description of the assailant. The officers quickly found the suspect in their database, by the name of Juan Madrazo, and are now searching for him.
