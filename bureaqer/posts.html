           In a recent survey conducted by this newspaper, residents of the local community expressed their concerns over traffic safety in the area. Many residents reported witnessing or experiencing close calls with vehicles while walking, biking, or driving in the neighborhood. The survey revealed that many residents believe that the main issue is speeding, with several respondents citing drivers not obeying speed limits or racing through residential streets. Others pointed to a lack of crosswalks or poorly marked intersections as contributing factors to unsafe conditions for pedestrians and cyclists. Residents also shared their thoughts on potential solutions to address the issue. Some suggested increasing police presence and enforcement of traffic laws, while others advocated for traffic calming measures such as speed bumps or traffic circles. A few respondents suggested that better education and awareness campaigns could help raise awareness about traffic safety in the community.
