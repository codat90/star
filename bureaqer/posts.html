            Valrise Star News reporter John Bough joined the SASD deputies on the field and documented their day-to-day activities.Â The prime reason behind this interaction was to learn more about the department, how they work, what is their goal, and what should we expect from them. A question that we addressed is - for what purpose was SASD formed when the San Andreas Police Department was already enforcing the law across the whole state?
