            From the trucks of the 90s to getting harassed by thugs, waste collector's lives are a hidden aspect of the modern society. With an annual income of $100,000, these people work all day long to make sure that all the trash gets disposed of to its ultimate location. As per Drex Collins and another collector who chose to remain anonym, their only demand is to get a handsome salary. For that, they are planning to create a union and throw their demands in front of the upcoming governor. Getting robbed by criminals, hit and run by crazy drivers, being teased by the police, all of these are part of their daily lives.Â
